# stay-awake

Don't let your Mac sleep with this simple menu bar application.

## Why did you made another stay awake app?

I was using Caffeine till now but sadly the developer doesn't seem to work on it anymore + it doesn't look very nice with Yosemite. Other apps I've found offer lots of features I don't wanted. Simply click to stay awake and click to disable is all I need ;).
